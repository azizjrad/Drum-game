# Drum-game

This my second JavaScript project i was learning it from my Course and i really appreciate all the effort that Angela Yu made ^^

So, i learned much more advanced tools and tricks than the previous project this was more challenging for me, And we used a JS library "JQuery" this makes my life easier than using vanilla JS, I learned how to add JQuery my project and show the sequence to the user with animations and sounds, Check which button is pressed, Add sounds to button clicks, add animations to user clicks, Check the user's answer against the game sequence, and display the game over and how to restart the game and I used more advanced DOM manipulation in this project
